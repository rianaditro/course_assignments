    "### **SQL Basics**\n",
    "Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It enables users to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures. Understanding SQL is essential for anyone working with databases, as it provides a powerful and efficient way to interact with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database: A collection of organized data stored and accessed electronically.\n",
    "- Table: A set of data elements organized in rows and columns within a database.\n",
    "- Query: A request for data or information from a database.\n",
    "- Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table.\n",
    "- Foreign Key: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL allows for querying and modifying data, as well as performing various operations like filtering, sorting, and grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common SQL Commands:\n",
    "- SELECT: Retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
    "- INSERT: Add new records into a table.\n",
    "- UPDATE: Modify existing records.\n",
    "- DELETE: Remove records from a table.\n",
    "- JOIN: Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column."
