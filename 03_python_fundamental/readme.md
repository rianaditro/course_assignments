# Python Fundamental Project

## Introduction
In web scraping, we frequently work with **strings, lists, dictionaries, loops, and control structures**. To ensure you have a solid understanding of these fundamentals, you must complete all the notebook tasks provided.

## Instructions
### Option 1: Complete All the Notebook Tasks
If you are new to these Python concepts, complete all the provided notebook tasks before attempting the project.

### Option 2: Skip to the Project
If you are already familiar with **strings, lists, dictionaries, loops, and control structures**, you may skip the notebook tasks and proceed directly to the project.

## Project1: Build a Contact Phone Book App
Your task is to create a **command-line Contact Phone Book application** that allows users to:
1. **Add contacts** (name and phone number)
2. **View all contacts**
3. **Search for a contact by name**
4. **Delete a contact**
5. **Exit the program**

## Requirements:
- Name your program **contact_app.py** and save it in the same directory.
- Use a **list of dictionaries** to store contact information.
- Ensure proper handling of user inputs and errors.
- Implement loops and conditionals to control the program flow.

## Project2: Build a Simple Calculator App
Your task is to create a command-line Calculator application that allows users to:
1. **Add two numbers**
2. **Subtract two numbers**
3. **Multiply two numbers**
4. **Divide two numbers**
5. **Exit the program**

## Requirements:
- Name your program **calculator_app.py** and save it in the same directory.
- Use functions to perform each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Ensure proper handling of user inputs and errors (e.g., division by zero).
- Implement loops and conditionals to control the program flow.

## Submission
Once completed, **send a pull request** for grading.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
