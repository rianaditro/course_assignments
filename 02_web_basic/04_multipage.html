<!-- Task 4: Multipage Navigation -->
<!-- Objective: Learn how to create navigation between multiple pages. -->

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="page1.html">Page 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="page2.html">Page 2</a></li>
        <li><a href="page3.html">Page 3</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>

<!-- To-Do:
1. Create a new HTML page with some content and add it to the navigation.
2. Change the text of one of the navigation links to “Back to Homepage”.
3. Add a "previous" and "next" button for page navigation (using anchor tags).
4. Add a dropdown menu in the navigation for mobile users.
5. Create a footer navigation that links to privacy policy and terms of service.
6. Implement "active" class on the current page in the navigation list.
7. Add a search bar inside the navigation that filters content across pages.
8. Make the navigation bar sticky so it stays at the top as you scroll.
9. Include a link in the navigation for an external resource on web scraping.
10. Style the navigation links with CSS to make them more user-friendly.
