# Simple Web App Project

This project is designed to assess your proficiency in basic web development. If you are already confident with this, you can jump straight into the project or submit your previous work in the YOUR_PROJECT_HERE folder. However, if you are still learning, please complete the step-by-step exercises before attempting the final project. 

The app consists of the following pages:

- **Home Page**
![home](images/home_page.png)
- **About Page**
![about](images/about_page.png)
- **Contact Page**
![contact](images/contact_page.png)
- **Form Submission Page**
![submit](images/form_submition.png)

### Instructions
1. **Setup the Project:**
   - If using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, create separate `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files for each page.
   - You can use any text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.) to write your code.

2. **Replicate the Screenshots:**
   - Start by replicating the layout of the pages based on the screenshots.
   - Pay attention to the overall structure, colors, and design elements.
   - Ensure that the navigation links between the pages work correctly (e.g., the "Home" link should navigate to the home page).

3. **Improve the Design (Optional):**
   - You are encouraged to improve the design by adding your own style or features. Some ideas for improvement:
     - Add a responsive design to make the app mobile-friendly.
     - Improve the form validation and error messages.
     - Add animations or transitions for smoother user experience.
     - Enhance the design with custom fonts, colors, or icons.

4. **Form Submission Page:**
   - Implement the form functionality so that users can submit their information to a window pop-up.

5. **Submission:**
   - Push all your answer to the github and send a Pull Request for grading.


### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy:** How closely you replicated the design based on the screenshots.
- **Creativity:** Any improvements you made to the design or functionality.
- **Usability:** The functionality of the navigation, forms, and links.
- **Code Quality:** The structure and readability of your code.

Good luck, and have fun building your project!
