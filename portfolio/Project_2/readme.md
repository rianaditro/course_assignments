#### **Problem Solved:**  
Real estate agents and investors often need to compare property listings across multiple websites. This project helps to consolidate information like pricing, location, property details, and images into one place.

#### **Challenges When Scraping:**  
- **Diverse Data Formats:** Different websites may have varying layouts, data structures, and formats (HTML, JSON, XML).  
- **Pagination and Updates:** Listings often span multiple pages and update frequently.  
- **Geolocation & Media Extraction:** Extracting address information and associated images accurately.

#### **Deliverable:**  
**Web App** â€“ Develop an interactive web application that allows users to search, filter, and view property listings on an integrated map (using Google Maps API, for instance).

#### **Additional Features:**  
- Alerts for new listings in selected areas or within certain price ranges.  
- Data visualizations such as price trends, heatmaps for location clustering, etc.

#### **Resources & References:**  
Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
