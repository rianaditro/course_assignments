## *Problem from upwork client :

https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021867433526407762261

I need a list of paintings by the artist Gilbert Stuart.

Here is the website: https://www.wikiart.org/en/gilbert-stuart/james-monroe-1822

You can advance to new paintings by using the white/blue buttons shown in the attached screenshot.

I want the basic facts about each painting and the image address in a Google sheet. I have entered the first six items.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WetMQYdM9iEDhusA1OKK-gEAuSapBzDxOVzsQ6fIegU/edit?usp=sharing

All of the items have a title, date, and an image address. Some of them also have entries for media, location, and dimensions.

There are a total of 73 artworks.

## *Solution :
Structur html of wikiart like class or id not well-defined so I am use xpath selector to targeting each element then i am using scrapy framework since BeautifulSoup cannot handel xpath.
