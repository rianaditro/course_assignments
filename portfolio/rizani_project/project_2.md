## *Problem  :
Scrape title, brand, price, and description from [hijup.com](https://www.hijup.com/id/)

## *Solution :
ijup.com is a big marketplace so I use the Scrapy framework to crawl information, scarapy has a feature filtering category and handles pagination. Also, this project has a simple analysis to get the average price for each brand and which material is the highest price for the brand.
