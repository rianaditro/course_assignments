### **Project 3: Social Media Sentiment Analysis for Brands**

#### **Project Concept:**  
Build a pipeline that scrapes posts, comments, and reviews from social media sites, blogs, or forums to analyze public sentiment regarding a brand or product.

#### **Industry:**  
Digital Marketing, Social Media Analytics

#### **Upwork Job Post Example:**

#### **Problem Solved:**  
Companies need to monitor public sentiment to understand customer opinions and improve their brand reputation. This project collects user-generated content and processes it to determine overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

#### **Challenges When Scraping:**  
- **API Rate Limits:** Platforms like Twitter limit how many requests you can make, so you must plan for efficient data retrieval.  
- **Unstructured Data:** Social media text is often noisy and unstructured, requiring advanced text processing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stop word removal).  
- **Spam/Bots:** Filtering out non-genuine content can be challenging.

#### **Deliverable:**  
**Kaggle Notebook** â€“ Provide a well-documented notebook that demonstrates data extraction, cleaning, sentiment analysis using NLP libraries (such as NLTK or spaCy), and visualization of sentiment trends over time.

#### **Additional Features:**  
- Topic modeling to find common themes in user discussions.  
- Interactive visualizations (using libraries like Plotly) that allow exploration of sentiment data.

#### **Resources & References:**  
Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
