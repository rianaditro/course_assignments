### **Project 7: News Aggregation and Trend Analysis Platform**

#### **Project Concept:**  
Develop a platform that scrapes news articles from multiple sources, categorizes them by topic, and performs trend analysis over time. The goal is to provide insights into what topics are currently trending in the news.

#### **Industry:**  
Media, Journalism, Data Analytics

#### **Upwork Job Post Example:**  
- [Example Job Post 1](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021873202576112625014)  
- [Example Job Post 2](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/~021847367997149215692)

#### **Problem Solved:**  
Media outlets, marketing agencies, and analysts benefit from a centralized source of current news, allowing them to identify trending topics quickly and monitor how news cycles evolve.

#### **Challenges When Scraping:**  
- **Variety of Sources:** Different news sites use different formats (HTML pages, RSS feeds) for content delivery.  
- **Duplicate Content:** The same article may appear on multiple sites.  
- **Metadata Extraction:** Capturing publication dates, author names, and article tags accurately.

#### **Deliverable:**  
**Video Recording** â€“ Create a detailed video walkthrough that demonstrates the entire process: from scraping news content to cleaning the data, categorizing topics, and visualizing trends through an interactive dashboard.

#### **Additional Features:**  
- Customizable filters for topics, regions, or publication dates.  
- Integration with social media analytics to cross-reference trending topics.  
- Automated alerts for breaking news or significant trend changes.

#### **Resources & References:**  
Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
