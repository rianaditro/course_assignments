### **Project 1: E-Commerce Price Monitoring and Competitive Analysis**

#### **Project Concept:**

Build an automated system that scrapes competitor pricing, product availability, and discount data from various e-commerce websites. The goal is to gather current market pricing data to help businesses adjust their own prices competitively.

#### **Industry:**

E-commerce, Retail, Price Comparison

#### **Problem Need to be Solved:**

Retailers need real-time data to compare their prices with competitors. By monitoring competitor prices, a business can adjust its own pricing strategy to remain competitive.

#### **Challenges When Scraping:**

- **Dynamic Content:** Many e-commerce sites load data via JavaScript (AJAX). You may need tools like Selenium or Puppeteer to render pages before scraping.
- **Frequent Layout Changes:** Websites often update their design, which can break your scraping code. Your code should be modular and easy to update.
- **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Websites might block IPs, use CAPTCHAs, or require user-agent spoofing. Consider strategies like rotating proxies or using headless browsers.

#### **Deliverable:**

**Web Dashboard** â€“ Create an interactive dashboard (using tools like Dash, Streamlit, or a custom web app) that displays price trends over time, highlights significant price changes, and provides options to export data.

#### **Additional Features:**

- Integration with a predictive model to forecast future pricing trends.
- Notification system (via email or SMS) when competitors drop prices significantly.

#### **Resources & References:**

Include any references you used for this project. While not mandatory, adding references can greatly enhance the credibility and professionalism of your portfolio.
