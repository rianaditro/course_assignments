    "### What is TLS?\n",
    "TLS is the encryption protocol used for securing data transfer between a client (like a web browser) and a server (like a website).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How JA3 Works:\n",
    "1. **Client Hello Message:** When a browser connects to a website using HTTPS, it sends a \"Client Hello\" message.\n",
    "2. **TLS Fingerprint:** This message includes:\n",
    "   - Supported TLS versions\n",
    "   - Cipher suites (encryption algorithms)\n",
    "   - Compression methods\n",
    "   - Elliptic curves and extensions\n",
    "3. **JA3 Hash Generation:** These parameters are hashed into a unique string called a **JA3 fingerprint**.\n",
    "4. **Recognition:** Servers can compare the JA3 hash against known fingerprints to identify the client type (like Chrome, Firefox, Python scripts, etc.)."
