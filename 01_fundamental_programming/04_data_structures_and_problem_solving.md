## **Introduction to Data Structures and Problem Solving**  
### **Introduction:**  
Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure is essential for solving problems effectively in software development.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What are data structures?** â€“ Ways to store and manage data.  
2. **Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.**  
3. **Sorting and searching algorithms.**  
4. **Problem-solving strategies using data structures.**

### **Example:**  
**Problem: Find the largest number in a list.**  
**Algorithm:**  
1. Start  
2. Define a list of numbers  
3. Assume the first number is the largest  
4. Loop through the list and compare each number  
5. If a number is larger than the current largest, update it  
6. Print the largest number  
7. End

### **Questions:**  
1. **What are data structures, and why are they important in programming?**  
Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data by structuring it in a computer system or database that facilitiates access to the data.

as for the important role of data structures in programming because the data structure as a database manager, file compression to affect the accuracy of a program algorithm.
2. **What are the differences between a list, an array, and a dictionary?**  
the difference between list, array and dictionary is 
1. list (a collection of data in certain order that can contain various types of data)
2. array (a collection of data with the sama data type stored in memory sequentially)
3. dictionary (an unordered collection of data consisting of keys and values)
3. **How does sorting data help in solving real-world problems? Find a case study.**  
one example of sorting data that can help solve a problem in the real world is in a university. how to monitor all students in the university. including grouping students entry year data, giving NIM to registered students, majors taken by students and personal data of the students themselves(from the students region of origin, educational background to the occupation of the students's parents).
4. **Why do some problems require searching algorithms like binary search instead of a simple scan?**  
because the binary algorithm itsel uses the divide and conquer priciple. which divides a large problem into smaller problems until a solution to the problem is found.
5. **How would you design a system to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data?**  
the main step in building a system to store and retrieve large amounts of data is storage management. where we need a place to store the data and after retrieving the data. and organize the data or gruop the data that has been retrieved to make it easier when retrieving the data. ususally the data is stored in a database.
6. **What is the difference between static and dynamic data structures?**  
static data strucuture are structures that have a fixed structure. data strucutures can be modified but without changing the allocates memory space.

dynamic data structures are data structures that have data that is not fixed and can be changed during the process.
7. **What are some real-world applications of data structures like stacks and queues?**  
example a simple application of stack and queues data structures

example of simple application of stack (the process of retrieving a stack of zinc or asbestos sheets, starting from the top, because the basic process of stack is to retrieve the last one first)

a simple example of the application of queues (the process of queuing tickets in a game, the front row or the first row to be processed or served ticket transactions)
8. **Why do software engineers choose different data structures for different problems?**  
the purpose of choosing differnt data structures in solving different problems is to shorten the processing tim or efficiency, and the level of accuracy in solving the problem.
9. **How does memory allocation impact the performance of data structures?**  
the role of memory allocation in data structures is very important, as the basic function of data structures is to make a program more efficient, faster and manageable.
10. **What is the relationship between problem-solving and choosing the right data structure?**  
the relationship between problem solving and choosing the right data structure is an attachment between the two. choosing the right data structure can improve the efficiency and performance of a program, on the contrary, if it is not right in choosing the data structure, it can make the program less slower and require a lot of time.
