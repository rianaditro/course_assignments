## **Introduction to Data Structures and Problem Solving**  
### **Introduction:**  
Data structures help organize and store data efficiently. Choosing the right data structure is essential for solving problems effectively in software development.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What are data structures?** â€“ Ways to store and manage data.  
2. **Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.**  
3. **Sorting and searching algorithms.**  
4. **Problem-solving strategies using data structures.**

### **Example:**  
**Problem: Find the largest number in a list.**  
**Algorithm:**  
1. Start  
2. Define a list of numbers  
3. Assume the first number is the largest  
4. Loop through the list and compare each number  
5. If a number is larger than the current largest, update it  
6. Print the largest number  
7. End

### **Questions:**  
1. **What are data structures, and why are they important in programming?**  
Data structure is a way of storing and organizing data by structuring it in a computer system or database that facilitiates access to the data.

as for the important role of data structures in programming because the data structure as a database manager, file compression to affect the accuracy of a program algorithm.
2. **What are the differences between a list and a dictionary?**  
the difference between list, array and dictionary is 
1. list (a collection of data in certain order that can contain various types of data)
2. array (a collection of data with the sama data type stored in memory sequentially)
3. dictionary (an unordered collection of data consisting of keys and values)
3. **How does sorting data help in solving real-world problems? Find a case study.**  
one example of sorting data that can help solve a problem in the real world is in a university. how to monitor all students in the university. including grouping students entry year data, giving NIM to registered students, majors taken by students and personal data of the students themselves(from the students region of origin, educational background to the occupation of the students's parents).
4. **Why do some problems require searching algorithms like binary search instead of a simple scan?**  
because the binary algorithm itsel uses the divide and conquer priciple. which divides a large problem into smaller problems until a solution to the problem is found.
5. **Why do software engineers choose different data structures for different problems?**  
the main step in building a system to store and retrieve large amounts of data is storage management. where we need a place to store the data and after retrieving the data. and organize the data or gruop the data that has been retrieved to make it easier when retrieving the data. ususally the data is stored in a database.
6. **How does memory allocation impact the performance of data structures?**  
the role of memory allocation in data structures is very important, as the basic function of data structures is to make a program more efficient, faster and manageable.
