## **Introduction to Pseudocode and Logical Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
**Pseudocode** is a way of writing algorithms in plain English mixed with programming-like structures. It **doesn’t follow the syntax of a real programming language** but helps programmers plan their logic before writing actual code.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is pseudocode?** – A human-readable way to describe algorithms.  
2. **Basic pseudocode syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals).**  
3. **How pseudocode translates into real programming languages.**

### **Example:**  
**Pseudocode for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
```
BEGIN  
   INPUT number  
   IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN  
      PRINT "Even"  
   ELSE  
      PRINT "Odd"  
   ENDIF  
END  
```

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. **Why is pseudocode useful before writing actual code in a programming language?**  
because pseudocode itself is a pseudo description or informal program writing with the aim of being easily understood by humans.
2. **How does pseudocode differ from real programming languages like Python or JavaScript?**  
the difference between pseudocode and real programming languages such as python or javascript is the delivery process, where pseudocode is aimed at understanding programs in humans. while programming languages are intended or made specifically to be read by computers.
3. **What are some best practices for writing clear and understandable pseudocode?**  
there are several ways to write pseudocode that is clear and easy to understand. including language that is easily understood by anyone, has a clear structure, consistency, in writing and is equipped with certain symbols.
4. **Write a pseudocode to checking if a number is even or odd?**  
here are the basic building blocks of pseudocode,including title, declaration and implementation.
here's how to map the three basic building blocks.
1. title (title of the algorithm to be applieed or as the title to be write)
2. declaration (information about the algorithm to be created, containing the types of variables and constants that will be used)
3. implementation (is a process that will be carried out by the algorithm or the core of the algorithm)
5. **How would you write pseudocode to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list?**  
Tittle 
 chek number even or odd

Description
variable number : int

implementation
read number
if (number  mod 2 = 0) then
    print "even number"
else
    print "odd number"
endif
6. **What is the difference between sequential execution, selection (IF-ELSE), and iteration (loops) in pseudocode?**  
he difference between sequential execution, selection, and iteration in pseudocode are as follows:
1. Sequential (the computer will execute the code sequentially,each line from top to bottom)
2. Selection (the code is executed only if a condition is met, otherwise it is ignored)
3. Looping(the computer will run the same code repeatedly)
