## **Introduction to Pseudocode and Logical Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
**Pseudocode** is a way of writing algorithms in plain English mixed with programming-like structures. It **doesn’t follow the syntax of a real programming language** but helps programmers plan their logic before writing actual code.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is pseudocode?** – A human-readable way to describe algorithms.  
2. **Basic pseudocode syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals).**  
3. **How pseudocode translates into real programming languages.**

### **Example:**  
**Pseudocode for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
```
BEGIN  
   INPUT number  
   IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN  
      PRINT "Even"  
   ELSE  
      PRINT "Odd"  
   ENDIF  
END  
```

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. **Why is pseudocode useful before writing actual code in a programming language?**  
because pseudocode itself is a pseudo description or informal program writing with the aim of being easily understood by humans.
2. **How does pseudocode differ from real programming languages like Python or JavaScript?**  
the difference between pseudocode and real programming languages such as python or javascript is the delivery process, where pseudocode is aimed at understanding programs in humans. while programming languages are intended or made specifically to be read by computers.
3. **What are some best practices for writing clear and understandable pseudocode?**  
there are several ways to write pseudocode that is clear and easy to understand. including language that is easily understood by anyone, has a clear structure, consistency, in writing and is equipped with certain symbols.
4. **What are the basic building blocks of pseudocode, and how do they map to real programming concepts?**  
there are the basic building blocks of pseudocode,including title, declaration and implementation.
here's how to map the three basic building blocks.
1. title (title of the algorithm to be applieed or as the title to be write)
2. declaration (information about the algorithm to be created, containing the types of variables and constants that will be used)
3. implementation (is a process that will be carried out by the algorithm or the core of the algorithm)
5. **Given a simple task (e.g., checking if a number is even or odd), how would you write its pseudocode?**  
Tittle 
 chek number even or odd

Description
variable number : int

implementation
read number
if (number  mod 2 = 0) then
    print "even number"
else
    print "odd number"
endif
6. **How would you write pseudocode to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list?**  
Tittle 
calculate sum of all numbers in a list

Description
number : list

implementation
read number
sum = 0
for each number in number
    sum = sum + number
endfor
print sum

7. **What is the difference between sequential execution, selection (IF-ELSE), and iteration (loops) in pseudocode?**  
The difference between sequential execution, selection, and iteration in pseudocode are as follows:
1. Sequential (the computer will execute the code sequentially,each line from top to bottom)
2. Selection (the code is executed only if a condition is met, otherwise it is ignored)
3. Looping(the computer will run the same code repeatedly)
8. **Why is indentation and structure important in pseudocode readability?**  
there are several important roles between indentation and structure in pseudocode. indentation is used to make it easier to read a notation (IF,FOR and WHILE) while structure is used as a reference so that the creation of an algorithm is easier.
9. **How do you test pseudocode to check if it works before converting it into a real program?**  
the way to check the pseudocode before converting it into a real program is to review it manually, apply it with a flowchart, write it in a pseudocode editor and then convert it into a real program.
10. **What challenges might arise when translating pseudocode into an actual programming language?**  
there are several challenges that may arise when translating pseudocode into programming languages, namely causing confusion in understanding pseudocode, because there are no standard rules in writing. need a more thorough understanding, because writing is very subjective, following the author's style.
