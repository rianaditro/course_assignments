## **Understanding Algorithms and Flowcharts**  
### **Introduction:**  
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. Before we write code, we often use **flowcharts** to visually represent these steps. This makes it easier to understand and communicate the logic behind a solution.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is an algorithm?** â€“ A set of well-defined instructions.  
2. **Flowchart symbols and their meanings.**  
3. **Decision making in algorithms (IF-ELSE conditions).**  
4. **Loops and repetition in algorithms.**  

### **Example:**  
**Algorithm for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
1. Start  
2. Input a number  
3. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even"  
4. Else, print "Odd"  
5. End  

**Flowchart Representation:**  
ðŸŸ¢ **Start** â†’ ðŸ”· **Input Number** â†’ ðŸ”² **Check If Number % 2 == 0** â†’ â¬œ "Even" / "Odd" â†’ ðŸ”´ **End**
