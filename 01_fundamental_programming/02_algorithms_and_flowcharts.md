## **Understanding Algorithms and Flowcharts**  
### **Introduction:**  
An **algorithm** is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem. Before we write code, we often use **flowcharts** to visually represent these steps. This makes it easier to understand and communicate the logic behind a solution.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is an algorithm?** â€“ A set of well-defined instructions.  
2. **Flowchart symbols and their meanings.**  
3. **Decision making in algorithms (IF-ELSE conditions).**  
4. **Loops and repetition in algorithms.**  

### **Example:**  
**Algorithm for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
1. Start  
2. Input a number  
3. If the number is divisible by 2, print "Even"  
4. Else, print "Odd"  
5. End  

**Flowchart Representation:**  
ðŸŸ¢ **Start** â†’ ðŸ”· **Input Number** â†’ ðŸ”² **Check If Number % 2 == 0** â†’ â¬œ "Even" / "Odd" â†’ ðŸ”´ **End**

## Questions
1. **What makes an algorithm efficient, and why does efficiency matter?**  
there are several factors that make an algorithm efficient, including how an algorithm utilizes time an memory usage in solving problems

efficiency in algorithm is very important in terms of developing an application. because it can produce application or programs that are faster, efficient and optimal.
2. **What are the key differences between an algorithm and a program?**  
the main difference between an algorithm an a program is :
algorithm are more focused in terms of logical steps and are not tied to particular programming language. whereas program are more tied to programming language. with predetermined syntax or certain rules.
3. **How would you design an algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations?**  
there are many ways to design algorithm to determine the shortest route or path between two locations. one of which is by using dijkstra's algorithm. where the algorithm looks for the shortest distance from the calculation from the origin to the nearest point the to the second point and so on until it forms a graph.
4. **Can you think of an everyday task that can be represented as an algorithm? How would you write it?**  
an example of simple task in daily activities than can illutrate a process or flow of an algorithm is sweeping the house.
the steps are as follows:
1. we take a broom in the place cleaning tools in the house
2. hold the broom
3. down to the destination whera the first sweeping will be don (usually from front yard of the house)
4. move swinging the broom that we already hold until it hits dirt or dust forward until the dirt is collected
5. do the same thing in the next room, after the fron yard
6. until we reach the last room we clean (for example the kitchen)
7. after finishing sweeping the entire interior of the house
8. return the broom to its original place (place of cleaning tools)
9. wash your hands thoroughly (after carrying out the work)
10. finished
5. **What are the main components of a flowchart, and how do they help in understanding algorithms?**  
main components in a flowcharts are a collection of several basic symbols, which have their respective functions for each symbol. symbols or components in a flowchart are very helpful in uderstanding an algorithm. because with these components, the steps or sequence of activities in solving a task or problem are explained.
6. **Find two different flowcharts for sorting numbers and compare their effectiveness.**  
there are two types of flowcharts to sort a number
1. using the bubble sort method (sorting method by exchanging data continuously until it is certain that there are no more changes or exchanges)    
2. using insertion sort method(data sorting method by placing each data element in its position by comparing with existing data)
7. **Why is decision-making (IF-ELSE conditions) important in algorithms?**  
because by using these conditions the algorithm becomes more readable, eficient and managable.
8. **How would you modify a simple algorithm to handle unexpected errors or conditions?**  
a simple way to handle errors or unexcpected conditions in an algorithm is to add a conditional (IF,ELSE,ELSEIF) to the algorithm.
9. **What are the differences between linear and non-linear algorithms? Provide examples.**  
the difference between the two algorithm is that linear algorithms have a structured and sequential flow. whereas non-linear algorithms tend to be more complex eith their own flow and unpredictable.
example of linear algorithm is a sorting algorithm. example of non-linear algorithm are often applied in machine learning.
10. **How can flowcharts help in debugging and understanding software systems?**  
flowcharts are very helpful in debugging and understanding a software system, because flowcharts describe clearly, efficiently and effectively in a system.
