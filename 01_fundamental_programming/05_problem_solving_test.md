## **Problem-Solving Practice Questions**

### **Introduction:**  
These problems are designed to test your critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. By solving these, you will improve your logical reasoning and ability to approach real-world challenges with structured solutions.

### **Objective:**  
The goal of this exercise is to enhance your problem-solving skills by tackling a variety of puzzles. By the end of this task, you should be able to think critically and apply logical steps to solve complex problems.

### **Questions:**

1. **The Chocolate Bar Problem**  
   There is a chocolate bar that is divided into 16 smaller squares, and you have to break it down into individual squares. How many breaks are needed to split the entire bar into individual squares?  
    There is a chocolate bar that is divided into 16 smaller squares, and you have to break it down into individual squares. How many breaks are needed to split the entire bar into individual squares?  
   There are several ways to divide a chocolate bar into 16 small squares,
   1. divide the chocolate block by 2 parts (1 part has 8 small square blocks then divided by 2 into 4 small blocks, subdivided by 2 into 1 small square totaling 16 small squares)
   2. divide the chocolate block by 4 parts (each part has 4 small square blocks, subdivided by 4 into 1 small square totaling 16)
   3. divide the chocolate block by 1 by 1 until it becomes 16 small squares

2. **The Light Bulb Problem**  
   You have 3 light bulbs in a room and 3 switches outside the room. How can you figure out which switch controls which bulb if you can only enter the room once?  
   You have 3 light bulbs in a room and 3 switches outside the room. How can you figure out which switch controls which bulb if you can only enter the room once?  

   a simple way to find out which switch controls which light bulb in the room is to look at arrangement or sequence of existing switches. even without us seeing the lights in the room directly. because the standard installation of switches in electrical installations must be in order to follow the installed lights.
3. **The Water Jug Problem**  
   You have two jugs: one can hold 5 liters and the other can hold 3 liters. How can you measure exactly 4 liters using only these two jugs?  
   
   You have two jugs: one can hold 5 liters and the other can hold 3 liters. How can you measure exactly 4 liters using only these two jugs?  
   first step, we fill water into the 3 liter jug, then transfer the contents of the 3 liter jug to the 5 liter jug. then add another 1 liter to the 5 liter jug(which previously filled with 3 liters of water)
   
4. **The Wolf, Goat, and Cabbage Problem**  
   A farmer needs to get a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. He has a boat that can only carry him and one other item at a time. How can he cross the river with all three without the wolf eating the goat or the goat eating the cabbage?  

   A farmer needs to get a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. He has a boat that can only carry him and one other item at a time. How can he cross the river with all three without the wolf eating the goat or the goat eating the cabbage?  
   
   since the farmer's three items are a food chain, where the wolf eats the goat and the goat eats the cabbage, in order to cross the river without prey or eating each other, the food chain process must be crossed.
   1. first the farmer gets on the boat with cabbage across the river
   2. the farmer returns to the boat with the wolf
   3. finally the farmer rides the boat across the river with a goat
   with these conditions all the goods owned by the farmer will be safe across the river.

5. **The Bridge and Torch Problem (Multiple Versions)**  
   Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have only one flashlight, and at most two people can cross the bridge at a time. Different people walk at different speeds: 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes. When two people cross together, they must walk at the slower person's pace. How can all four people cross the bridge in 17 minutes?  
    
   explanation of the condition
   person 1 (D) = 1 minute
   person 2 (E) = 2 minute
   person 3 (F) = 5 minute
   person 4 (G) = 10 minute

   the steps are as follows:
   - D and E cross the bridge (D = 1 minute and E = 2 minutes, the time required is 2 minutes. taken from the longest time) then D = 1 minute back with a flashlight (2 minutes + 1 minute = 3 minutes)
   - F and G crossed the bridge (F = 5 minutes and G = 10 minutes, the time taken is 10 minutes. taken from the longest time)
   - total time before 3 minutes + 10 minutes = 13 minutes
   - D return with the flashlight (13 minutes total time + 2 minutes = 15 minutes)
   - D and E cross the bridge again (time taken 2 minutes) total time before 15 minutes + 2 minutes = 17 minutes

6. **The Coin Puzzle**  
   You have 12 coins, one of which is either heavier or lighter than the rest. Using a balance scale, what is the minimum number of weighings required to find the odd coin?  
   there are 3 possibilities that will happen
   - balance
   - left down
   - right down

   so 1 weighing process has 3 possibilities
   do 3 weighing process  = 3 * 3 * 3 = there are 27 possibilities
   (24 is smaller than 27)


   step one (12 coins divided into 3 groups (4,4,4))
   second step (weigh group 1 with group 2)
    - if the result is balanced (different coins are in group 3)
    - if the result is not balanced (it will be seen which group is heavier or lighter)
   step three (use the next 2 weighing process to narrow down the choice to 1 coins)

7. **The Egg Drop Problem**  
   You have two identical eggs and a building with 100 floors. The eggs are strong enough to be dropped from some floors, but will break if dropped from too high. What is the minim
   You have two identical eggs and a building with 100 floors. The eggs are strong enough to be dropped from some floors, but will break if dropped from too high. What is the minim
   
   make an estimate of the experiment that will be conducted 14 times

   1. drop the first egg from the 14th floor
   2. if it doesn't break, go up another 13 floors (to the 27th floor)
   3. if it still doesn't break, go up 12 floors again (to the 39th floor) and so on
   the sequence is as follows 14 - 27 - 39 - 50 - 60 - 69 - 77 - 84 - 90 - 95 - 99 - 100
   if the first egg breaks, use the second egg to do the experiment one by one from the bottom floor (then with 14 tries, it can represent the smallest value of the experiment)
