## **Introduction to Computational Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
Computers are powerful because they can solve complex problems quickly, but they don’t "think" like humans. **Computational thinking** helps us break down problems so that computers can understand and process them efficiently. Learning to **think like a programmer** will make it easier to understand coding later.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **Decomposition** – Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition** – Finding similarities between problems.  
3. **Abstraction** – Ignoring irrelevant details to focus on the main problem.  
4. **Algorithm Design** – Creating step-by-step solutions.  

### **Example:**  
Think about making a cup of coffee. What are the steps?  
- Boil water  
- Add coffee powder  
- Pour water into the cup  
- Stir and serve  

This is an **algorithm** because it follows a **logical sequence of steps**.
