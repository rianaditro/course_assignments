## **Introduction to Computational Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
Computers are powerful because they can solve complex problems quickly, but they don’t "think" like humans. **Computational thinking** helps us break down problems so that computers can understand and process them efficiently. Learning to **think like a programmer** will make it easier to understand coding later.  

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **Decomposition** – Breaking a large problem into smaller, manageable parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition** – Finding similarities between problems.  
3. **Abstraction** – Ignoring irrelevant details to focus on the main problem.  
4. **Algorithm Design** – Creating step-by-step solutions.  

### **Example:**  
Think about making a cup of coffee. What are the steps?  
- Boil water  
- Add coffee powder  
- Pour water into the cup  
- Stir and serve  

This is an **algorithm** because it follows a **logical sequence of steps**.  

## **Questions**  
1. **What is computational thinking, and why is it important for programmers?**  
computational thinking is a way to look at particular problem and find a solution, by breaking down the problem in detail to make it easier for the future.

because the initial foundation of programmer is to thnk systematically sequentially in creating a program or solving a problem.

2. **How do engineers and software developers use decomposition to solve problems?**  
engineers and developers work together to solve problem encountered in the development of the software by dividing the problem into several small parts, so that engineers can easily analyze the subject matter and developers are more efficient in fixing the problem.
3. **What are some real-world examples where pattern recognition is applied in technology?**  
there are many real world application of pattern recognition, including :
1. the use a visiojn camera in determining a product that is defective in production like a QC
2. the use of voice searching in smartphone
3. the use of weather forecast in the accuweather application
4. recommendation of a product in the marketplace based on the history product that we have searched for in the past.
4. **Why is abstraction necessary when designing a solution? Can you give an example from daily life?**  
abstraction plays an important role when it comes to designing a system, because the main function of abstraction is to simplify a complex system by ignoring small parts of the system and focusing on the main concept of the system.

an example of the application of simple abstraction in everyday life, for example we want to swim, then we prepare special clothes for swimming. in other we open the wardrobe to focus on finding swimming clothes for swimming, and ignore the many clothes in the wardrobe.

5. **What is the difference between an algorithm and a process?**  
the difference between an algorithm and process is a systematic and logical planning step or method designed to solve a particular problem. whereas a process is a series of stages contained in the algorithm.
6. **How do computers follow instructions differently than humans?**  
there are three stages or components, how computers can follow different instruciont from humans. namely from hardware, software and brainware.
7. **What are some common mistakes people make when writing instructions for others?**  
some of the commons mistakes that people make when writing instructions for other are lack of clarity in terms of delivering instructions, not being organized or sequential in writing instructions and not focusing on the instructions that will be delivered to others.
8. **How can algorithmic thinking be applied in fields outside of computer science?**  
a simplee example of algorithmic outside of computer science is when we want to make a cup of black coffe.
1. cook water wait until it boils
2. take a saucer or small plate for coaster
3. put the saucer on the table
4. take an glass on the glass rack or kitchen set
5. put the glass on the saucer
6. take a coffee stiring spoon (usually smal size)
7. take enough coffee powder from the coffee storage area
8. put the coffee powder into  the empty glass
9. take enough sugar from the sugar storage
10. put the sugar into the glass that already has coffee grounds
11. pour the boiling water into the glass that already has coffee, sugar and stirring spoon
12. stir until evenly distributed
13. pour enough the black coffee into the saucer up the cooling process
14. drink the coffee
15. finished
9. **Why do some problems require multiple solutions instead of a single best solution?**  
because the problem has its own characteristics, hence the need for multiple solutions instead of one best solution.
10. **How can you improve your problem-solving skills to think like a software engineer?**  
ways to improve your problem solving skills is to practice them regularly, to get used to solving problems. and practice finding new problems and trying to find solutions.
