## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you develop a foundational understanding of computer networks, specifically focusing on TCP/IP and the OSI model, which are critical for understanding how data is transmitted over networks.

By the end of this exercise, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts of networking, which will aid in troubleshooting network issues and improving your overall knowledge of web scraping and other network-related tasks. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is TCP/IP, and why is it important for computer networks?**  
TCP/IP is a collection of protocols that regulate data communication between devices on a network, including the internet.
TCP/IP is very important because it allows computer devices to communicate and exchange data efficiently and reliably.
2. **What are the main functions of TCP in a network?**  
TCP's main function in a network is to break down the data to be sent into smaller segments before it is sent over the network.S
3. **What role does IP play in a computer network?**  
The role of IP in a network is as an address for sending data to the device we are using.
4. **What is the difference between TCP and UDP, and when would you use each?**  
The main difference between TCP and UDP is that TCP is a connection-based protocol while UDP is not connection-based.

When should we use both types of connections?
TCP is best used in some applications such as sending emails or sms, transferring files and web searching.
while UDP is best used for live streaming, online gaming and video chatting.
5. **What is the OSI model, and why is it important in networking?**  
The OSI model is a concept that enables the exchange of information between different types of computer communication systems

because with the OSI layer model all components and protocols in computer networks are easy to understand and easy to monitor.
6. **What is the first layer of the OSI model, and what is its function?**  
The first layer of the OSI layer is Aplication, where the main function of the application is to provide services to various network applications for example (NNTP, H7, modbus, SIP and others).
7. **What does the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model do?**  
What layer 4 of the OSI layer does is provide end to end communication protocols, which are responsible for the successful delivery of data such as managing flow control, error detection, corection, data secuenting and size of the packet (data size).
8. **What is the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, and how does it work?**  
The workings of the 3rd layer of the OSI layer is to manage sessions that include stabilizing, maintaining and terminating between entities owned by the presentation layer.
9. **What is the role of the application layer (Layer 7) in the OSI model?**  
The main role of the 7th layer of the OSI layer is to determine electrical or waveform issues and various procedures related to physical links.
10. **How does understanding TCP/IP and the OSI model help in troubleshooting network issues?**  
Both models are very helpful in solving network problems, as they are closely related in terms of explaining how data can be transferred through a network.
