## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you understand the concept of APIs, how they function in retrieving data, and their significance in web scraping tasks.

By the end of this exercise, you will gain the skills to utilize APIs effectively, learn the importance of reading documentation, and understand key terms like API keys, JSON, endpoints, and rate limits. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is an API, and how does it help get data from websites?**  
API is a system that can connect two or more applications together and make programming activities easier.

The following is how the API gets data from the website. the application accesses the API then the API makes a request to the server, the server responds to requests from the API which then the API gives the results to the application.
2. **Why do some websites offer APIs instead of letting people copy data directly?**

3. **What is an endpoint in an API?**  
What is an API endpoint?
An API endpoint is a digital location where an application programming interface (API) receives API calls, also known as API requests, for resources on its server. API endpoints are components of APIs and are most often in the form of URLs, or uniform resource locators.
4. **What is a GET request?**  
get request is a process or technique to retrieve or send data that is public or can be seen by users
5. **What is an API key?**  
An API Key is a unique code assigned to an application to identify and authenticate access to a particular API. The API key is permanent, meaning that it does not change every time you send a request to the application.
6. **What is JSON?**  
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a text-based format that can be understood and read and is designed for data exchange purposes.
7. **What does "rate limit" mean?**  
rate limit is an endpoint in an application within a certain time. or the process of limiting the number of requests that a client or other system can make to a server within a certain period of time.
8. **What is Postman?**  
Postman is a computer application used in API testing. usually used by testers and developers for better application testing.
9. **Why is it important to read the documentation before using an API?**  
Reading the documentation before using an API is very important, because it is a guide that contains all the information needed to work with the API, from functions, work processes and solutions if problems occur in using the API.
10. **What are query parameters?**  
Query parameters are parameters that are added to the end of a URL to provide additional information to the web server when making a request.
